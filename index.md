I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University's Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence ([IPAI](https://www.purdue.edu/computes/institute-for-physical-artificial-intelligence/)), working with [Prof. Karthik Ramani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/current-convergence-design-lab-members/) at the Convergence Design Lab and [Dr. Sooyeon Jeong](https://www.sooyeonjeong.com/) at the HAI Lab.

I completed my PhD in 2024 at the University of Sydney, where my research focused on the [“Computational Design and Fabrication of Customizable Interactive Soft Devices”](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/32814), supervised by [A/Prof. Anusha Withana](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y17ckyIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Judy Kay](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4lr4HzgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also hold a Master of Data Science from the University of Sydney and a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering from Monash University.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of soft sensors, epidermal sensing technologies, and smart textiles. My goal is to create interfaces that seamlessly integrate with the human body and improve user-centric interactions.
