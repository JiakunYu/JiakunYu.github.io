> The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, 
> Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. 
> I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives that it connects. 
> It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old.
